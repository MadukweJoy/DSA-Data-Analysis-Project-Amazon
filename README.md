EDA involved exploring the Amazon data, using pivot tables and calculated columns to answer key questions such as:

2. How many products are listed under each category? 
3. What is the total number of reviews per category? 
4. Which products have the highest average ratings? 
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews? 
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)? 9. What is the total potential revenue (actual price × rating_count) by category? 
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., ₹500)? 
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?

14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
    
### Data Analysis

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- About 50% of products already have discounts greater than 50%. This will affect the company’s profit/revenue generated. 
- Only three products emerge with highest average ratings.

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis we recommend the following:
-	Focus on expanding the products with the highest average ratings.
-	Promote products with less than 1000 reviews.
